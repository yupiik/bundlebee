[abstract]
BundleBee is a light Java package manager for Kubernetes applications.
This page explains how to get started with it.

== Installation

=== Java  Mode

. Ensure to use java >= 11.0.7 (previous Java 11 versions can work but have an issue with TLS HTTP client you can hit).
. Download the `bundlebee-core` fat jar on https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/yupiik/bundlebee-core/ (ensure to take `-fat.jar` artifact).
. You can now run it with the command: `java -jar bundlebee-core-<version>-fat.jar`.

=== Binary

IMPORTANT: this only works for linux amd64 computers.

[source,sh]
----
curl -L https://yupiik.github.io/bundlebee/install/install.sh | bash
----

TIP: since 1.0.3, once installed this way (and your `PATH` variable updated to include bundlebee) you can use `check-update` command to check if a new version is available:
`bundlebee check-update [--update true]`.
The `--update true` option enables to automatically replace the binary if needed, not specifying it will just log if a new version can be downloaded.

== Create your first alveolus

=== Pre-requisite

BundleBee assumes it is installed itself indeed but depending how you package your alveolus it can require Java (>= 8) and Maven.
If they are not installed on your system, we encourage you to use link:https://sdkman.io/[sdkman] to do so.

TIP: this can be replaced by any zip packager and is not a strong requirement.

[[start_with_maven]]
=== Start with a maven project

There are a ton of ways to create a maven projects but here is the simplest one:

[source,bash]
----
mvn archetype:generate \
    -DgroupId=com.company \
    -DartifactId=my-app-alveolus \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart \
    -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 \
    -DinteractiveMode=false
----

Then you can go in `my-app-alveolus/`.
You can run `mvn package` to ensure your java/maven setup is correct.

At that stage we can start working on our alveolus but if you want to be "purist" you can clean up the default skaffolded project: `rm -Rf src/test/ src/main/java/`.

To start working on our alveolus, we will create `src/main/resources/bundlebee` folder: `mkdir -p src/main/resources/bundlebee`.

At that stage your project should look like:

[source]
----
.
├── pom.xml
└── src
    └── main
        └── resources
            └── bundlebee
----

To describe an application, you have to create a `manifest.json` file in this `bundlebee` folder:

[source,json]
.src/main/resources/bundlebee/manifest.json
----
{
  "alveoli": [
    {
      "name": "hello", <1>
      "descriptors": [
        {
          "name": "hello-world", <2>
          "location": "src/main/resources" <3>
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----

<.> Creates an alveolus named "hello",
<.> "hello" alveolus will use as descriptor (.yaml) "hello-world.yaml" which will be found in src/main/resources/`bundlebee/kubernetes`,
<.> References Bundlebee base folder because we are deploying in exploded mode (and not in a packaged jar).

Then add the referenced Kubernetes descriptor in `kubernetes` subfolder:

[source,yaml]
.src/main/resources/bundlebee/kubernetes/hello-world.yaml
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-deployment
  labels:
    app: hello
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: hello
          image: hello-world:latest
----

Here nothing changes from a "normal" .yaml used with kubectl.

Now you can deploy this executing `bundlebee apply --alveolus hello --manifest ./src/main/resources/bundlebee/manifest.json`.

And that's it, now hello world application should be up and running in your Kubernetes cluster.

TIP: it is more than encouraged to name the kubernetes descriptor based on the project unique identifier.
For example `<groupId>.<artifactId>.<alveolus_name>.yaml`.
It will avoid conflicts when multiple alveolus are in the same classpath using native java mode and not file driven mode.

You could also have used the `bundlebee-maven-plugin`, simply add it in the plugins section of the pom.xml :

[source,`xml`]
.pom.xml
----
<plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>io.yupiik</groupId>
      <artifactId>bundlebee-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${bundlebee.version}</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>hello-world</id>
          <phase>none</phase>
          <goals>
            <goal>apply</goal>
          </goals>
          <configuration>
            <manifest>${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/bundlebee/manifest.json</manifest> <1>
            <alveolus>hello</alveolus>
          </configuration>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
----
<.> Reference to the deployment entry point of your module, it is optional if bundled in a transitive dependency.

Then you can deploy this executing `mvn bundlebee:apply@hello-world`.

=== Start from scratch (without Java and Maven)

In this part we will reuse the descriptors of xref:#start_with_maven[Start with maven] section so we will just show how to bundle without Java/Maven the alveolus.

The overall goal is to create a zip containing the `manifest.json` and the Kubernetes descriptor.
Here is a small script helping to do that:

[source,bash]
----
#! /bin/bash

base="my-app-alveolus" <1>
mkdir -p "$base/bundlebee/" "$base/bundlebee/kubernetes/" <2>
----

<.> The name of the project (will create a root directory with this name)
<.> Create the alveolus structure

Now you can copy the descriptors as in xref:#start_with_maven[Start with maven] section in `my-app-alveolus/bundlebee/` folder.

Once done we just have to bundle it as a zip. One option on UNIx system is to use this command:

[source,bash]
----
#! /bin/bash

base="my-app-alveolus" <1>

cd "$base"
zip "$base.zip" -r . <2>
----

<.> Reuse the same setup than in previous script
<.> Create a zip containing the alveolus structure using `zip` command

And that's it.

TIP: this trick to create a zip can be adapted to any language (javascript, typescript, go, python, ruby, ...) and enables to bundle an alveolus in any build tool very easily.

== Going futher (K8s operator)

To learn how to deploy directly an `Alveolus` on Kubernetes you can check out our <<operator.adoc#,Operator>> documentation.

== Define custom templates

You can use an alveolus as a template for others providing contextual placeholders.
Learn more about this in <<template.adoc#,template>> documentation.

== Testing your alveoli with JUnit 5

Bundlebee provides a light testing framework integrated with JUnit 5 to ease the validation of alveoli.
Learn more about this in <<junit5.adoc#,junit5>> documentation.

== Integrate with ArgoCD

If you are using (or will to use) link:https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/[ArgoCD^], you can still use BundleBee if you configure it as a plugin.
See the xref:argocd-integration.adoc[related] documentation.
