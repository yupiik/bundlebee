Also note that the command used there only work for BundleBee >= 1.0.25, for versions before use process command to dump the descriptors and then a small script to cat them for ArgoCD.\nNow create a plugin docker image:\nEnsure to adjust the version you want to use at your needs,\nEnsure to add the plugin configuration we just created locally in previous step (target location is required by the entry point).\nyou can also use the native version of BundleBee but this requires some more knowledge about the Java native dependencies (apk add --no-cache zlib libstdc++ gcompat for alpine for example).\nThe launching script will be something like:\nAnd the discovery script will be something like:\nthe placeholder discovery and descriptor templating assume ArgoCD application name matches the alveolus name, you can modify the script to make it more resilient.\nThen build the image: docker build -t yupiik/argocd-bundlebee-plugin:latest ..\nNow we need to add this configuration into a sidecar of ArgoCD (CMP server). To do that, edit argocd-repo-server descriptor (we explain how to do it manually but you can do it with BundleBee): kubectl edit deploy -n argocd argocd-repo-server.\nAdd the plugin container:\nKeep default container(s),\nSet the image you just built.\nThe limitations of the integration is that BundleBee does not deploy any more, it is just used as a templating engine (similarly to helm integration) so ArgoCD is the deployer. The drawback of that option is you loose the deployment options (like forcing PUT to force to override a resource, the control of the merge strategy when you install a resource or the awaiting logic which is different).\nPlease also note that ArgoCD:\nIs a runtime so you must ensure it is\nup and running,\nhas enough allocated resources (including to redeploy a new version if you use rollout),\nmonitored for upgrades when needed (security + features),\nhas enough storage for its usage (avoid a disk full for ex),\nhas a correct monitoring to ensure you don’t get into infra troubles if you host it on premise.\nDoes not come with a solution for secrets (and passwords/keys management) so you still need an option for that,\nDoes use a custom RBAC model for security which is not always trivial to set up.\nAs any software is a new thing to learn for your ops team and can compete with the idea of CI/CD (which has its own RBAC model for example),\nSince it will store your clusters client configuration, the cluster ArgoCD is installed on must have very secured secrets (don’t use a weaky-leaky dev environment for example),\nSimilarly to the cluster, if you use some ciphering solution, ensure its storage is very well secured (can go through Kubernetes secrets if you have a specific backend - ie not the default one).\nThis is why at Yupiik we tend to not use ArgoCD but prefer a plain CI/CD pipeline which is offline (does not need a constant runtime resource allocation nor infra monitoring and is self-resilient since you just need git to restore an application). Most of the time we couple it with BundleBee diff command to ensure if the cluster is synchronized or not with the git state. We combine it with a ciphering to save password/keys in git, depending the project it can be a Vault, keypass or just our (de)crypt maven goal which uses a master password for that task (similarly you can use {{bundlebee-decipher:$masterKeyPlaceholder,$cipheredValue}} placeholders, see more on how it works page). Finally, combine with minisite generator we get live documentation reporting (including potential placeholders) which makes the solution complete.\nit is highly recommended to work on these points before adopting ArgoCD (using BundleBee or not indeed) and to evaluate the plain CI/CD option - including installing a light CI/CD like Harness/Drone which is simpler to setup.","title":"ArgoCD integration","url":"//www.yupiik.io/bundlebee/argocd-integration.html"},{"lang":"en","lvl2":"Configuration","text":"Name: build.\nBuild a project.\nBundle artifactId.\nProject to build.

It relies on placeholders to be contextualized and, in general, placeholders are provided in the context if a contextual alveolus which represents the consumer.\nBut why using templates? Most of the time, the Kubernetes flavor you are using (OpenShift for example or a cloud specific instance or with a particular service mesh stack) is relying on specific metadata/labels etc… Your company can also standardize the way to write kubernetes descriptors. All that make it quite hard to define generic and maintainable descriptors generally speaking but it also makes it quite repetitive to write it for each microservice in your own context.\nTo solve that issue, Bundlebee enables you to write a generic contextual alveolus (a deployment, a service etc…) and bind placeholders from another alveolus.\nthe context is the alveolus and not the dependency to ensure the binding is more obvious and not ultra nested. it can require you to split a bit the definition in the manifest.json but it is to simplify the maintenance.\nTo create a template, just define a standard alveolus with placeholders in descriptors. For example:\nHere we can see we just defined an alveolus requiring the placeholders:\nservice.name,\nservice.app,\nservice.type,\nservice.port.\nthis is a valid alveolus, if you provide all the placeholders you can install it directly but it is not recommended to ensure it is reproducible.\nTo use the template previously defined, just define another alveolus which binds the required placeholders in its definition:\nimport the template in the alveolus,\nBinds the placeholders of the imported template.\nif your alveolus imports a dependency reimporting the template, the placeholders nesting will be respected which means the context is always the deepest one.","title":"Create your own templates","url":"//www.yupiik.io/bundlebee/template.html"},{"lang":"en","lvl2":"Configuration","text":"Name: create-master-password.\nGenerate a master password if none exist (in ~/.m2/settings-security.xml)\nMaster password value, if auto it will be generated.

The --update true option enables to automatically replace the binary if needed, not specifying it will just log if a new version can be downloaded.\nBundleBee assumes it is installed itself indeed but depending how you package your alveolus it can require Java (>= 8) and Maven. If they are not installed on your system, we encourage you to use sdkman to do so.\nthis can be replaced by any zip packager and is not a strong requirement.\nThere are a ton of ways to create a maven projects but here is the simplest one:\nThen you can go in my-app-alveolus/. You can run mvn package to ensure your java/maven setup is correct.\nAt that stage we can start working on our alveolus but if you want to be \"purist\" you can clean up the default skaffolded project: rm -Rf src/test/ src/main/java/.\nTo start working on our alveolus, we will create src/main/resources/bundlebee folder: mkdir -p src/main/resources/bundlebee.\nAt that stage your project should look like:\nTo describe an application, you have to create a manifest.json file in this bundlebee folder:\nCreates an alveolus named \"hello\",\n\"hello\" alveolus will use as descriptor (.yaml) \"hello-world.yaml\" which will be found in src/main/resources/bundlebee/kubernetes,\nReferences Bundlebee base folder because we are deploying in exploded mode (and not in a packaged jar).\nThen add the referenced Kubernetes descriptor in kubernetes subfolder:\nHere nothing changes from a \"normal\" .yaml used with kubectl.\nNow you can deploy this executing bundlebee apply --alveolus hello --manifest ./src/main/resources/bundlebee/manifest.json.\nAnd that’s it, now hello world application should be up and running in your Kubernetes cluster.\nit is more than encouraged to name the kubernetes descriptor based on the project unique identifier. For example <groupId>.<artifactId>.<alveolus_name>.yaml. It will avoid conflicts when multiple alveolus are in the same classpath using native java mode and not file driven mode.\nYou could also have used the bundlebee-maven-plugin, simply add it in the plugins section of the pom.xml :\nReference to the deployment entry point of your module, it is optional if bundled in a transitive dependency.\nThen you can deploy this executing mvn bundlebee:apply@hello-world.\nIn this part we will reuse the descriptors of Start with maven section so we will just show how to bundle without Java/Maven the alveolus.\nThe overall goal is to create a zip containing the manifest.json and the Kubernetes descriptor. Here is a small script helping to do that:\nThe name of the project (will create a root directory with this name)\nCreate the alveolus structure\nNow you can copy the descriptors as in Start with maven section in my-app-alveolus/bundlebee/ folder.\nOnce done we just have to bundle it as a zip. One option on UNIx system is to use this command:\nReuse the same setup than in previous script\nCreate a zip containing the alveolus structure using zip command\nAnd that’s it.\nthis trick to create a zip can be adapted to any language (javascript, typescript, go, python, ruby, …) and enables to bundle an alveolus in any build tool very easily.\nTo learn how to deploy directly an Alveolus on Kubernetes you can check out our Operator documentation.\nYou can use an alveolus as a template for others providing contextual placeholders. Learn more about this in template documentation.\nBundlebee provides a light testing framework integrated with JUnit 5 to ease the validation of alveoli.

In other words, the goal is to be able to reuse Maven registries (central, custom nexus, artifactory, …) to store application descriptors. It also leverage the well know java packaging (jar or zip) to ensure a strong storage reliability in these systems.\nOne direct benefit is that it becomes very easy to have an immutable system once deployed and therefore a better tracability of what is deployed.\nOverall, BundleBee will manipulate what we call alveolus which are basically just a set of descriptors. An alveolus is a zip or a jar which is structured this way:\nA bundlebee folder contains all the descriptors\nA manifest.json contains the list of application or library this alveolus provides\nA kubenetes folder contains the list of descriptors used by alveoli\nManifest is the central point of the system. It provides the unique identifier of your recipe (application/library) and what to do to set it up.\nHere is its configuration specification:\nBundleBee manifest descriptor.\nName\nJSON Name\nType\nDescription\ninterpolateAlveoli\nbool\nEnables to consider all alveoli have their interpolateDescriptors descriptor set to true, you can still set it to false if you want to disable it for one.\nManifest.alveoli\nalveoli\narray of object\nList of described applications/libraries.\nManifest.ignoredLintingRules\nignoredLintingRules\nIgnored linting rule names when using lint command.\nManifest.references\nreferences\nList of files referenced as other manifests. They are merged with this (main) manifest by appending requirements and alveoli. It is relative to this manifest location. Important: it is only about the same module references, external references are dependencies in an alveoli. It enables to split a huge manifest.json for an easier maintenance.\nManifest.requirements\nrequirements\nPre manifest execution checks (bundlebee version typically). Avoids to install using a bundlebee version not compatible with the alveoli. Can be fully omitted.\nchainDependencies\nShould dependencies be installed one after the other or in parallel (default). It is useful when you install a namespace for example which must be awaited before next dependencies are installed.\ninterpolateDescriptors\nEnables to consider all descriptors have their interpolate descriptor set to true, you can still set it to false if you want to disable it for one. If not set, interpolateAlveoli flag from the manifest.\nname\nstring\nName of the alveolus (recipe). It must be unique accross the whole classpath. Using maven style identifier, it is recommended to name it <groupId>:<artifactId>:<version> using maven filtering but it is not enforced.\nversion\nIf name does not follow <groupId>:<artifactId>:<version> naming (i.e. version can’t be extracted from the name) then you can specify the version there. Note that if set, this is used in priority (explicit versus deduced).\nAlveolus.dependencies\ndependencies\nDependencies of this alveolus. It is a way to import transitively a set of descriptors.\nAlveolus.descriptors\ndescriptors\nList of descriptors to install for this alveolus. This is required even if an empty array.\nAlveolus.excludedDescriptors\nexcludedDescriptors\nList of descriptors to ignore for this alveolus (generally coming from dependencies).\nAlveolus.patches\npatches\nPatches on descriptors. It enables to inject configuration in descriptors by patching (using JSON-Patch or plain interpolation with ${key} values) their JSON representation. The key is the descriptor name and each time the descriptor is found it will be applied.\nplaceholders\nobject\nLocal placeholders for this particular alveolus and its dependencies. It is primarly intended to be able to create a template alveolus and inject the placeholders inline.\nlocation\nWhere to find the alveolus. Note it will ensure the jar is present on the local maven repository.\nAlveolus name.\nDescriptor.includeIf\nincludeIf\nConditions to include this dependency. Enables for example to have an environment variable enabling part of the stack (ex: MONITORING=true)\nawait\nIf set to true, apply/delete commands will await the actual creation of the resource (GET /x returns a HTTP 200) before continuing to process next resources. It is useful for namespaces for example to ensure applications can be created in the newly created namespace. It avoids to run and rerun apply command in practise. For more advanced tests, use awaitConditions.\nawaitOnDelete\nOn delete we rarely want to check the resource exists before but in these rare case you can set this toggle to true.\ninterpolate\nIf set to true, it will interpolate the descriptor just before applying it - i.e. after it had been patched if needed. You can use --<config-key> <value> to inject bindings set as {{config-key:-default value}}. If not set, interpolateDescriptors flag from the alveolus will be used.\nOptional, if coming from another manifest, the dependency to download to get the alveolus.\nName of the descriptor to install. For kubernetes descriptors you can omit the .yaml extension.\ntype\nType of this descriptor. For now only kubernetes is supported. It also defines in which folder under bundlebee the descriptor(s) are looked for from its name.\nDescriptor.awaitConditions\nawaitConditions\nTest to do on created/destroyed resources, enables to synchronize and await kubernetes actually starts some resource. For apply and delete commands, descriptorAwaitTimeout is still applied. Note that if you use multiple array entries for the same command it will be evaluated with an AND.\nConditions to include this descriptor.\noperator\nOperator to combine the conditions. Potential values: ANY (At least one condition must match.),ALL (All conditions must match.).\nConditions.conditions\nconditions\nList of condition to match according operator.\nkey\nExpected key. If empty/null condition is ignored. If read value is null it defaults to an empty string.\nnegate\nShould the condition be reversed (ie \"not in this case\").\nType of condition. Potential values: ENV (Key is read is process environment variables.),SYSTEM_PROPERTY (Key is read is process system properties.).\nvalue\nExpected value. If empty/null, true is assumed. Note that empty is allowed.\ncommand\nCommand to apply these conditions to, if not set it will be applied on apply command only. Note that for now only apply and delete commands are supported, others will be ignored.\nAwaitConditions.conditions\nconditionType\nWhen condition type is STATUS_CONDITION it is the expected type of the condition. This is ignored when condition type is JSON_POINTER.\noperatorType\nThe operation to evaluate if this condition is true or not. (for type=JSON_POINTER). Potential values: EXISTS (JSON Pointer exists model.),MISSING (JSON Pointer does not exist in the resource model.),EQUALS (JSON Pointer value is equal to (stringified comparison) value.),NOT_EQUALS (JSON Pointer is different from the provided value.),EQUALS_IGNORE_CASE (JSON Pointer value is equal (ignoring case) to (stringified comparison) value.),NOT_EQUALS_IGNORE_CASE (JSON Pointer is different (ignoring case) from the provided value.),CONTAINS (JSON Pointer contains the configured value.).\npointer\nJSON Pointer to read from the resource. It can for example be on /status/phase to await a namespace creation. (for type=JSON_POINTER).\nType of condition. Potential values: JSON_POINTER (JSON Pointer evaluation (fully custom).),STATUS_CONDITION (Evaluate items in /status/conditions.).\nWhen condition type is JSON_POINTER and operatorType needs a value (EQUALS for example), the related value. It can be Active if you test namespace /status/phase for example. When condition type is STATUS_CONDITION it is the expected status.\nThe container of the descriptor (maven coordinates generally).\nName of the descriptor (as declared, ie potentially without the extension).\ndescriptorName\nThe descriptor to patch. It can be any descriptor, including transitive ones. It can be * to patch all descriptors (/metadata/label/app for example) or regex:<java pattern> to match descriptor names with a regex.\nIf set to true, it will interpolate the patch from the execution configuration which means you can use --<config-key> <value> to inject bindings too. An interesting interpolation is the ability to extract the ip/host of the host machine (minikube ip equivalent) using the kubeconfig file. Syntax is the following one: {{kubeconfig.cluster.minikube.ip}} or more generally {{kubeconfig.cluster.<cluster name>.ip}}. You can also await for some secret with this syntax {{kubernetes.<namespace>.serviceaccount.<account name>.secrets.<secret name prefix>.data.<entry name>[.<timeout in seconds, default to 2mn>]}}. This is particular useful to access freshly created service account tokens for example.\npatch\nJSON-Patch to apply on the JSON representation of the descriptor. It enables to inject configuration in descriptors for example, or changing some name/application.\nConditions to include this patch. Enables for example to have an environment variable enabling part of the stack (ex: MONITORING=true)\nName of the rule to ignore.\npath\nRelative or absolute - starting by a / - location (referenced to the base directory of manifest.json). For example my-manifest.json will resolve to /path/to/bundlebee/my-manifest.json in a folder and /bundlebee/my-manifest.json in a jar. Important: for resources (jar/classpath), the classloader is used so ensure your name is unique accross your classpath (we recommend you to prefix it with the module name, ex :`/bundlebee/my-module.sub-manifest.json` or use a dedicated subfolder (/bundlebee/my-module/sub.json).\nmaxBundlebeeVersion\nMinimum bundlebee version, use `*`to replace any digit in a segment. Note that snapshot is ignored in the comparison for convenience. It is an inclusive comparison.\nminBundlebeeVersion\nMinimum bundlebee version, use * to replace any digit in a segment. Note that snapshot is ignored in the comparison for convenience. It is an inclusive comparison.\nforbiddenVersions\narray of string\nList of forbidden version (due to a bug or equivalent). Here too snapshot suffix is ignored. is usable there too to replace any digit in a segment (ex: 1..). Note that 1. would NOT match 1.., version are always 3 segments.\nmanifest content can be wrapped in a bundlebee key (you wrap the whole content) which enables you to add other metadata in the manifest and still reuse BundleeBee JSON-Schema for the validation (by composition).\nIf you use JSON-Schema facilities in your preferred editor, here is the raw JSON-Schema for the manifest descriptor:\nyou can also use last version from this link.\nA manifest can reference descriptors in other alveoli, it just requires to reference them to let bundlebee find them.\nThere are mainly two ways to deploy an alveolus:\nClasspath mode: you put all your zip/jar in the classpath. This mode requires there is no conflict between descriptor names (which is the recommended practise) and it will never look for external descriptors. It is typically a recommended mode to avoid network I/O except with the Kubernetes cluster.\nFetch mode: in this mode, a missing descriptor in the classpath will look for descriptor.location and lookup the jar/zip referenced by this location (generally a maven coordinate in the form groupId:artifactId:version). It will first use your local Maven repository but can download the jar/zip if missing locally. Then the jar/zip is read and descriptors are looked up from there. This mode is nicer when depending on a lot of external alveoli but requires I/O to grab the dependencies.\nIndeed, you can bundle all your stack and hardcode your configuration or create one alveolus per environment. This is one option which works well and enable to version its configuration.\nHowever, for testing purposes, it is also neat to be able to patch descriptors on the fly. For that you can use descriptor.patches in the manifest which will transitively enable to patch the descriptors - even the ones you don’t own - using JSON-Patch and interpolations.\nHere are some examples.\nWe add to the alveolus a list of patches to apply on some descriptors\nWe reference the descriptor to patch\nWe enable interpolation from Microprofile Config (which include CLI args)\nWe define the JSON-Patch to use (optional, interpolation will also interpolate the descriptor if designed to be interpolated)\nWe use an interpolation in the configuration in the JSON-Patch replace operation which replaces the data of the referenced ConfigMap\nthis mecanism is very useful for ConfigMap descriptors but also PersistenceVolume since you can now patch `/spec/hostPath `easily too.\nIn some case it can be neat to be able to not deploy part of the stack. It is typically the case when you wrote a monitoring-full alveolus (ie with some optional services functionally). In such a case you can condition dependencies and descriptor deployment:\nused on descriptors and using a complete set of conditions for descriptors you can handle environments this way (ENV=preprod for descriptor preprod.configmap for example).\nIn some case it can be needed to evaluate some values of the manifest when executing the command. Even if not recommended it can be done using {{xxx}} placeholders - read from environment variables and system properties.\nWith this manifest you can value project.version and bundlebee.version using the command line:\nPlaceholders can use some keywords to get some particular values:\nalveolus.name: name of the alveolus the descriptor comes from,\ndescriptor.name: name of the descriptor,\nbundlebee-strip:<value>: strips the provided value,\nbundlebee-strip-leading:<value>: strips the provided value at the beginning,\nbundlebee-strip-trailing:<value>: strips the provided value at the end,\nbundlebee-indent:<indent size>:<value>: indents a value with the provided space size, it is generally combined with another interpolation (file ones in particular) as value, ex {{bundlebee-indent:8:{{bundlebee-inline-file:myfile.txt}}}},\nbundlebee-inline-file:<file path>: load the file content as value,\nbundlebee-base64-file:<file path>: converts the file in base64 (useful to write data:xxxx,<base64> values for ex keeping the raw file in the filesystem, very helpful for images),\nbundlebee-base64-decode-file:<file path>: decode the file from a base64 content,\nbundlebee-base64:<text>: encodes in base64 the text,\nbundlebee-base64-decode:<text>: decode from base64 to text the value text,\nbundlebee-digest:BASE64|HEX,<algorithm>,<text>: computes the digest of the text encoded in base64 or hexa format (useful to read files like ConfigMap or Secret and inject their digest value in a Deployment annotations to force its reload for example),\nbundlebee-quote-escaped-inline-file:<file path>: load the file content as a quoted value,\nbundlebee-json-inline-file:<file path>: load the file content as a JSON string value - without quotes,\nbundlebee-json-string:content: escapes a string to be a JSON string (useful when you inject with bundlebee-json-inline-file a string in another string like in JSON ConfigMap in a JSON configuration),\nbundlebee-maven-server-username:<server id>: extract from your maven settings.xml a server username (see configuration for a custom settings.xml location),\nbundlebee-maven-server-password:<server id>: extract from your maven settings.xml a server password (potentially deciphered),\nbundlebee-decipher: use Maven ciphering logic (AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding) to read a clear value. Syntax is as follow {{bundlebee-decipher:$masterKey,$cipheredValue}} with masterKey another placeholder name which contains the master key and cipheredValue the value to decipher. Indeed we recommend to reference the master key with another shared placeholder if you use a single one ({{bundlebee-decipher:{{myMasyterKey}},$cipheredValue}}). Last, since the value will be surrounded by { and }, we tolerate spaces before/after to avoid any confusion with the mustable like syntax we use for placeholders: {{bundlebee-decipher:{{my.master.key}}, {…base64….} }},\nbundlebee-kubernetes-namespace: the Kubernetes namespace defined in the HttpKubeClient,\nkubeconfig.cluster.<cluster name>.ip: extract cluster IP from your kubeconfig,\ntimestamp: current time in milliseconds (since epoch),\ntimestampSec: current time in seconds (since epoch),\nnow: OffsetDateTime.now() value,\ndate:<pattern>: format OffsetDateTime.now() value using the provided pattern,\nnowUTC: OffsetDateTime.now() value with UTC ZoneId,\nkubernetes.<namespace>.serviceaccount.<account name>.secrets.<secret name prefix>.data.<entry name>[.<timeout in seconds>]: secret value looked up through Kubernetes API.\njsr223:<script path as file or resource or inline script>: executes a JSR223 script to get the result, assumes that the script engine implementation is available in the JVM (not by default). To find the engine it uses the file extension or a comment in the file (for inline script) containing bundlebee.language: <lang>. The script contains the two functions lookupByName and lookupByType which can lookup a CDI bean to reuse BundleBee utilities (ex: const bean = lookupByType.apply(getType('io.yupiik.bundlebee.core.kube.KubeClient'))). If no language is found it defaults on js.\nbundlebee-directory-json-key-value-pairs:/path/to/dir: creates a JSON object from a directory. The path can be either a directory path of a directory path with a glob pattern at the end (/path/to/dir/*.txt for example). The keys are the filenames (simple) and __ are converted to /. The values are the content of the files, filtered. Note it only works with exploded folders, not jar resources as of today.\nbundlebee-directory-json-key-value-pairs-content:/path/to/dir: same as bundlebee-directory-json-key-value-pairs but dropping enclosing brackets to be able to embed the content in an existing object (like annotations). Ex: {{bundlebee-directory-json-key-value-pairs-content:resources/app/annotations/*.txt}}.\nIf none of these placeholders match, then Microprofile Config is used to lookup the value (so system properties, environment variables and BundleBee args are used).\nfile placeholders can also read a resource from the classpath if the path does not match any existing file.\nthis feature is still experimental and value interpolation can be refined.\nSometimes it can be more convenient to use handlebars language to templatize the descriptors (not the manifest) rather than placeholders. It is the case when you have some logic depending some placeholder or value.\nit is also generally the case your template becomes complex so before jumping into handlebars templating please think if you should split your template in multiple imported files or just multiple files.\nBy replacing the .json or .yaml extension of the descriptor in kubernetes/ (sub)folder(s) by .hb or .handlebars you can use Yupiik fusion-handlebars templating running on java >= 17 and adding the dependency to the classpath (not available yet in native mode).\nThen the descriptor, if interpolated is set to true in the manifest (as usual) will be interpolating using Handlerbars engine.\nThe main difference is that it gives you conditional blocks.\nYou can still use the plain placeholder interpolation since we try to keep a compatibility layer and default functions with some corner cases but most will work smoothly.\nwe still recommend to use JSON format instead of YAML since it is harder to break even using handlebars.\nFinally you can use alveolus.name, descriptor.name which will be correctly interpolated.\nOn windows, the usage of the Java mode is recommended and the most reliable, however, if you want to speed up a bit the execution you can run the native bundlebee executable in a docker image.\nensure to test this solution on your machine, on our test machine gain can be x2 but it depends the docker setup too.\nOnce done you would be able to replace bundlebee by docker run bundlebee -v $HOME/.kube/config:/kube/config -e KUBECONFIG=/kube/config --network host (use an alias ;)).\nHere are the step to use this solution:\nDownload bundlebee native binary, for that go on https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/yupiik/bundlebee-core/, select the version you want and download the file ending with Linux-amd64,\nCreate this Dockerfile file next to the binary you just downloaded and renamed bundlebee:\nRun docker build -t bundlebee . in the folder you put bundlebee binary and previous Dockerfile\nthis dockerfile works as of today because binaries are build on Ubuntu 20.10, you can need to adjust a bit libraries if this changes - this is why Java mode is simpler.\nLinting is quite specific so it has its own documentation.","title":"How it works","url":"//www.yupiik.io/bundlebee/how-it-works.html"},{"lang":"en","lvl2":"Configuration","lvl3":"Inherited Global Configuration","text":"Name: http.\nExecute a HTTP request over Kubernetes client.

There are a lot of solutions out there from the lightest to the heaviest (using minikube locally).\nBundlebee brings an in-between solution with bundlebee-junit5 module which enables to write simple tests in plain JUnit 5.\nbundlebee-junit5 sets up a \"ok\" Kubernetes API mock (always responding HTTP 200 {}) - indeed you can control that, see later. The test are executed against this API mock ensuring all the resolution of descriptors, placeholders and patches are successfully passed.\nThis mock also enables you to inject validation in it which means you can also validate the shape or context of what is sent to kubernetes (after interpolations and enrichment).\nAfter having added the following dependency:\nYou can start writing tests with @ValidateAlveolus API (equivalent to @Test):\nJust putting the annotation on a test method will run implicitly bundlebee apply.\nHowever, it is recommended to use a setup closer to the deployment and to assert what happens at deploy time:\nHere , we injected CommandExecutor and LogCapturer. The first one enables to manually control when the command is applied and last one enables to retrieve the logs associated to the command execution (what is printed). This enables to check the command output.\nYou can go further injecting in the method parameters KubernetesApi. Similarly to log validation, it enables to validate the sent requests to Kubernetes API:\nindeed you can combine log and API validations in the same test.\nThe API is richer than just these example, for example, KubernetesApi enables you to inject your own IOPredicate<HttpExchange> which basically gives you the keys of the mock. In this mode the capture does not work anymore but you don’t really care since you see all requests going through and you can handle your validations there (ensure to fail in the test thread and not predicate which is using a HTTP server thread). It also enables you to respond more complex responses and potentially start from a different - not empty - state in your mocked kubernetes (reinstallation, deletion etc…).\nFinally, you can also check the API in the package io.yupiik.bundlebee.junit5 since @ValidateAlveolus enables, for example, to fully customize the command to execute.\nlast tip is that options of @ValidateAlveolus support to use placeholders filled from system properties in the form of {{xxx}}.

CompletionStage enable to run validations in parallel easily.\nWhen not needed, just go with the SynchronousLintingCheck base interface or one of its children.\nA check is composed of:\nA name which enables to disable/force the check to run,\nA remediation string which explains how to fix the violation when it happens,\nA decription explaining the validation,\nA validate (or sync flavor) method doing validation when a descriptor is visited,\nSometimes an afterAll method doing validations after all descriptors were seen (for joins accross desriptors for example).\nYaml descriptors are converted to JsonObject and descriptors containing a list are flattened.\nWhat does it means is that you always validate a single descriptor which is an object in check code which makes it easier to work with.\nIt is not yet possible to define custom rules, it is not very complicated to do it technically but the language (must be JSON based) is challenging. Here are the current evaluated options:\nCustom DSL: likely the most powerful and consistent option since we could define it in manifest.json but requires to learn yet another language,\nJSON-Logic: a very good option but requires a lot of operators and resulting DSL is not that friendly/simple,\nTemplate based: idea there is to define a few options (\"check this value at this JSON pointer\", \"check this chain of json pointer\", …) but this becomes quite hard to have a relevant dictionary set without making it overcomplex,\nScripting based: we can run jruby/jython/js engine rules but they all required to embed a script manager runtime and they tend to be fatty for this need and not all are graalvm friendly to convert bundlebee to native mode.\nSo as of today, since we didn’t find a compromise making us happy we didn’t enable to define JSON DSL based rules. Since it is easy to add custom rules in Java (and using the maven plugin), this is not blocking but we’d like to tackle it if we can come up with a better idea. Don’t hesistate to propose something on bundlebee github project if you have an idea or a common need.","title":"Linting","url":"//www.yupiik.io/bundlebee/linting.html"},{"lang":"en","lvl2":"Configuration","text":"Name: list-alveoli.\nLists all found alveoli\nRoot dependency to download to get the manifest.
